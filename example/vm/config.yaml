processors:
    # We recommend use of the batch processor.  We recommend the settings
    # below for traces.
    #
    # Note: We are aware of ongoing efforts within OpenTelemetry to
    # configure batching in the exporter, where it is possible to
    # configure batch size limits in terms of bytes, instead of items.
    # We will update these recommendations when batching by size is
    # available.
    batch:
        # In this example, the processor will wait to accumulate at least
        # 1000 spans for up to 1 second, then flush the batch.  In cases
        # where the arriving data is already batched, such that combining
        # the pending batch with the arriving data would exceed 1500
        # items, then 1500 items will be sent by splitting the data.
        #
        # Note: the batch processor has a side-effect of returning success
        # to the producer, before waiting for the consumer to respond.
        # This is appropriate default in most cases, it means that SDKs
        # sending to the gateway will not see or report errors.
        #
        # The batch processor responds to "back-pressure" from the
        # exporter, meaning it is never directly responsible for dropping
        # spans.  Note that our current recommendation for exporter
        # settings does not respond with back-pressure to the batch
        # processor.  Due to exporter settings, this collector
        # configuration will drop data when the ServiceNow service is
        # (intentionally or accidentally) refusing data, instead of
        # applying pressure backward, discussed in the `exporters`
        # section.

        # While we expect latency under one second, typically, we

        timeout: 5s
        # Queue settings are required.  It does not make sense to use
        # the exporter without a queue, it has to do with
        # requiring the "num_consumers" limit configured in this
        # section (i.e., we require a queue in order to limit the
        # number of concurrent exports).
        #
        # Note that the queue settings are applied in unit-terms
        # produced by the batch processor, so a number like 100 means
        # the queue has support for 100 pre-batched items.  With up to
        # 1500 spans each (from the batch processor), this
        # configuration allows 150,000 spans to occupy memory.

        # Retry settings are optional.
        #
        # Note that while retries are attempted, this component will
        # begin to drop arriving data if the queue is not large
        # enough.
        retry_on_failure:
            # We recommend disabling retries, since while the export is
            # blocked it is likely that arriving spans will drop, and
            # Otherwise, collectors will need substantial additional
            # memory to survive transient failures.  Nevertheless, we
            # recommend a limited retry policy to gracefully occasional
            # failures, paired with a modest queue size.
            #
            # Note there is a persistent storage option inherited from a
            # common collector component.  When persistent storage is
            # configured, the default retry configuration is sensible.
